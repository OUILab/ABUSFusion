# Neural Operator Formulation for IMU to Pose Prediction

## Input Function

Let $u(t): [0, T] \to \mathbb{R}^6$ be the input function representing IMU data:

$u(t) = [a_x(t), a_y(t), a_z(t), \omega_x(t), \omega_y(t), \omega_z(t)]^T$

where $a_i(t)$ are accelerations and $\omega_i(t)$ are angular velocities.

## Output Function

Let $v(t): [0, T] \to \mathbb{R}^6$ be the output function representing pose:

$v(t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t), \theta(t), \phi(t), \psi(t)]^T$

where $x(t), y(t), z(t)$ are positions and $\theta(t), \phi(t), \psi(t)$ are orientation angles.

## Operator

We aim to learn the operator $\mathcal{G}: \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{V}$ such that:

$\mathcal{G}(u)(t) = v(t)$

where $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are appropriate function spaces.

## Discretization

In practice, we work with discretized versions:

$u_i = u(t_i)$ and $v_i = v(t_i)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, N$

## Neural Operator Approximation

We approximate $\mathcal{G}$ with a neural operator $\mathcal{G}_\theta$:

$\mathcal{G}_\theta(u)(t) \approx v(t)$

where $\theta$ are the learnable parameters.

## Training

Minimize the loss function:

$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \|\mathcal{G}_\theta(u)(t_i) - v(t_i)\|^2$
